# Trench-Profile-Measurement-with-3D-point-clouds
This project was for computer vision course at Asian Institute of Technology.

In this project, I performed the following tasks.
- I created 3D point clouds model of two trenches from multiple raw RGB images.
- I collected 3D point clouds of the same trenches with Intel Realsense D455 camera.
- I measure the width and depth of the trenches using MeshLab software and took the results as ground truth. 
- I implemented an algorithm with Python to measure the width and depth of the same trenches took the results as measurement result.
- I calculated the percent error using ground truth and measurement result.

** In presentation slide (pdf format), I explained the detail.**
